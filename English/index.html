<h1>
    Is overwatch 2 really dying after cancellation of the PvE mode and current game balance issues!?
</h1>

<h5>
    With the cancellation of the PvE mode which was promised to be something really big and worth the 4 year long wait
    with lack off content, and the balancing team not satisfying players there is no wonder people think the game is
    dying, however is that really the case? well let’s look at it in more detail why PvE got cancelled why the lack of
    content and what the current state of the game is.

    Overwatch 2, the sequel of Overwatch 1, was announced on November 1, 2019, at BlizzCon with big plans to bring a new
    and incredible PvE experience to Overwatch. However, the game's development team focused on Overwatch 2, so the
    content for Overwatch 1 was significantly decreased. On April 14, 2020, Echo was released, and the development team
    said that would be the last hero for Overwatch 1. However, after Echo, almost no new content was released, and year
    after year, the same game modes were used. Players had hope for Overwatch 2, but the developers didn't share a lot
    of information. Finally, on June 16, 2022, the Overwatch 2 beta was officially released after three long years, and
    new heroes were promised, such as the new hero Sojourn.

    The game's developers started streaming a lot and shared very positive news for the game. However, In those
    developer streams, they kept talking about the PvP part and barely about the PvE, players were concerned about the
    lack of information about the PvE part. which got players concerned. However, they said it would release next year
    and released Overwatch 2 early for the new heroes and content with a graphical update. However, people quickly
    realized the many bugs and the change from 6v6 to 5v5 with many tanks being changed because instead of 2, there is
    now only 1 tank each team with way faster team fights and way more fast-paced gameplay, which not a lot of people
    liked. Also, the game felt like it was lacking a lot of features from previous game even the community calling it
    overwatch 1.2.

    The game's development team announced the cancellation of the PvE mode on May 16, 2023, The mode was previously
    defined by its upcoming PvE Hero Mode, which aimed to transform gameplay. Blizzard Entertainment will no longer get
    its planned PvE Hero Mode campaign, as game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss have confirmed
    the long-delayed mode is now canceled. four-year-long wait for nothing, and the balancing team not satisfying
    players, has led to concerns about the game's future. “We struggled to find our footing with the Hero Mission
    experience early on. Scope grew. We were trying to do too many things at once and we lost focus,” ”Keller said. "The
    team built some really great things, including hero talents, new enemy units and early versions of missions, but we
    were never able to bring together all of the elements needed to ship a polished, cohesive experience."

    The conclusion being free to play, the resent focus on PvP with more content and the release of a new hero every 2
    seasons overwatch 2 is not near its end anytime soon at least according to the current numbers. He knows that they
    still have a long way to go. They still will make mistakes, and they'll still try things that people don't love, and
    that's totally fine. But the real goal is, to make a game that people believe is well-supported, well-loved, and
    that they feel is being well-served…
